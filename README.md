A fully functional Chess application built with **Java** and **Swing** (JFrame). The project focuses on object-oriented programming principles and implementing complete chess logic.

## 🚀 Features

- **GUI:** Interactive board using Grid Layout and Swing components.
- **Move Validation:** Each piece follows standard chess movement rules.
- **Game States:** Detection of Check, Checkmate, and Stalemate.
- **Turn-based System:** Enforces white/black turns.
